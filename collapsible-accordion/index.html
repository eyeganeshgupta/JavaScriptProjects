                    King Shivaji was born in 1630 into a family of Maratha bureaucrats. His father was a Maratha general
                    in the army of the Bijapur Sultanate, and Jijabai. His Mother had him grow up studying religious
                    teachings of Hindu and Sufi saints- she was very religious. Dadoji Konddeo was Shivaji’s
                    administrator who played a big role in his upbringing after Shivaji’s father left with his second
                    wife. He taught him how to ride a horse, archery, marksmanship, Patta, and other fighting
                    techniques.

                    Chandragupta Maurya founded the Maurya Empire, which stretched across Kashmir in the north to Deccan
                    Plateau in the south and Afghanistan and Balochistan in the west to Bengal and Assam in the east. He
                    seized the Macedonian territories and conquered the eastern territories of Alexander’s general
                    Seleucus making his territory even larger. Maurya was one of the most important rulers in the
                    history of India who is credited with unifying small independent states in India to form a large
                    single kingdom under one administration.

                    The spread of Buddhism in many parts of the world is credited to Emperor Ashoka who was the third
                    ruler of the Mauryan Empire. He was also known as ‘Ashoka the Great’ as he ruled almost the entire
                    Indian subcontinent. He focused on expanding his empire continuously. His reign is considered one of
                    India’s most glorious periods.
                    Ashoka went on and on with his conquests but had a turnaround after his bloodiest and most lethal
                    one at Kalinga- it left him shattered and changed him from a fierce vengeful ruler to a peaceful and
                    non-violent emperor.

                    King Prithviraj Chauhan, alias Rai Pithora, was a Rajput king and one of the last independent Hindu
                    kings to rule the kingdom of Delhi. His father was king of Ajmer. Prithviraj was an exceptional
                    child- he was very brave and intelligent. His military prowess shone through even in his childhood-
                    he could hit targets by only following their sounds! After the death of his father in a battle in
                    1179, Prithviraj Chauhan succeeded the throne. He ruled over the twin capitals of Ajmer and Delhi
                    which he had received from his grandfather.

                    Emperor Akbar was from the Mughal empire and was one of the greatest monarchs in the history of
                    India. He was born in 1542 to Mughal emperor Humayun and Hamida Banu Begum. His father was in exile
                    hence Akbar was raised by his paternal uncles, spending time hunting, horse riding, playing sword,
                    and running, which made him a trained and skillful warrior. He did not attend regular school and
                    hence did not learn to read and write. Rather he had various subjects such as history, religion,
                    science, philosophy, and other topics recited to him. It is remarkable that this made him
                    knowledgeable in almost all subjects, illiteracy notwithstanding.
